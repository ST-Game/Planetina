# Planetina

**Come save the world! **

## Concept

In **Planetina** you save the world from environmental hazards and prevent irreversible damages to the planet and its population. You'll need to use your super powers to save the planet from megafires, air pollution, light pollution, low O2 and high CO2 levels etc.  
The player will gain different powers during the game and will need to manage the hazards and resolve them with minimum impact on the planet and the population.

## Formal Elements

### 1. Players

* The game is suited for player of ages 7-99 that are looking for a challenge while saving the planet. 
* The game is designed for a single player, but has a leader board. 
* Players will compete to make it to the top of the leader board.



### 2. Goals

* The player’s objectives are to save the planet from all the hazards that he encounters, using his super abilities. The player will win when the planet will be able to take on the environmental hazards without Planetina’s help.
* The player will learn the objectives of the game during the tutorial and the game itself via achievements.
In the tutorial the player will face a complex situation, with multiple hazards taking place, and will be guided through solving them.
* The player won’t be able to change the game’s objectives.


### 3. Processes


* The first 30 second will be of major hazards and the game will guide the player how to save the planet from each of the hazards. The player is using the keyboard to maneuver throw the planet to get to the hazard, once getting to the scene, there will be a mini game of how to resolve the hazard. On each hazard the player will have the option to choose one of 2 solutions, one will be sustainable and the other will be temporary.
* The core of the game: the player is flying in the planet and if there is a hazard there will be an alarm on the top of the screen. Once a hazard has appeared the player can choose to fly to it or not by using the keyboard. 
* The end of the game: in order to win the game the player needs to make must of the solutions he chose be sustainable, the score will be higher for the sustainable solutions.

### 4. Rules

* The player’s actions will be defined by his effort to maintain the appropriate levels:
    - O2 levels (between 19%-23%)
    - CO2 levels (0.03%)
    - N levels (between 75% - 78%)
    - planet temperature level (between 44C – (-32C))
    - Land precents (between 40%-30%) / Water levels (between 60%-70%)

*The player’s score will be impacted by the way and speed he resolved the hazards, and by the solution he chose – sustainable solution will get more points.
*The player will learn the basic rules of the game at the tutorial, how to  gain more points he’ll learn by playing.

### 5. Resources
*The resources in the game are the super powers that the player gains from playing and wining in in each day and event – ultimately Planetina can have control on all 5 elements: air, water, earth, fire, super strength.
*The player can use each of his super powers to create a sustainable solution to each hazard he come across, although losing amount of coins he holds, the player will gain more point to the final score.
*There will be specific hazards that resolving them using the sustainable solution will make the player gain a new super power. Each super power can be upgraded and the player can become stronger with each hazard he resolve.
*There will be a bar with 5 icons for all of the super powers, each time the player will gain a super power/managed to make it stronger it will appear in the abilities bar.


### 6. Conflict
*The game is days based – each day the player will have one or many hazards to deal with.
The bars of the levels of each material rules will either hurt the earth and the population or sustain them.
*The conflict between the player and other players will be in the leaderboard.
*The player’s conflicts with himself will be whether to invest in sustainable and expensive solution or the cheap and un-sustainable solution.
	
### 7. Boundaries
*The boundaries of the game are the planet, the world will be round so the player could fly in the sky.
*The player won’t be able to leave the atmosphere, but late in the game the player can gain an ability of wide-sight.

### 8. Results
*There are   possible outcomes:
	1.Perfect score – The player has resolved each hazard he came across with using the sustainable solution and he saved the planet!
	2.Good score – The player mostly chose the sustainable solution therefore he saved the planet!
	3.The planet died – if the player  ignores hazards or chose only not-sustainable solutions.
*The outcome depends on the hazards randomly picked for the player and how he handles them.
